{\ttfamily libwfa} provides a C++ library for the analysis of wavefunctions. This analysis is based on density matrices, which provide a unified formalism independent of the underlying wavefunction model.

The methods which have been implemented are described in detail in Ref. \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} and examples are provided in Ref. \mbox{[}2\mbox{]}. Further developments are covered in Refs \mbox{[}4\mbox{]} and \mbox{[}5\mbox{]}. Briefly, the implemented methods consist of the following parts\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Analysis of state density matrices for
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item population analysis,
\item density plotting,
\item natural orbitals, and
\item analysis of unpaired electrons.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Analysis of transition density matrices for
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item plotting of the {\itshape hole} and {\itshape electron} densities,
\item plotting the transition density,
\item natural transition orbitals (NTOs) with a possibility for state-\/averaging,
\item entanglement analysis based on NTOs \mbox{[}6\mbox{]},
\item {\itshape electron-\/hole} correlation analysis using the charge transfer numbers (see also Ref. \mbox{[}3\mbox{]}).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Analysis of difference density matrices for
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item plotting of the attachment/detachment densities,
\item attachment/detachment population analysis, and
\item natural difference orbitals.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Real-\/space analysis of properties within an exciton picture, see Refs \mbox{[}4\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}5\mbox{]}.
\item Electrostatic potentials of various effective densities.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The required input from the quantum chemical program consists of the density matrices of interest, the AO-\/overlap matrix, the MO coefficients (used for orthogonalization), and information for population analysis. For the exciton analysis routines also the dipole and quadrupole integrals are needed.
