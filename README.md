Please contact one of the authors if you are interested in interfacing libwfa to your quantum chemistry code. See LICENSE for licensing information.

To compile the standalone version, type:
~~~~
./configure
cd build
make
~~~~

Testing of the standalone library is only possible via the libtest library, which is part of Q-Chem. Compile libtest, then type:
~~~~
cd libwfa/tests
../build/tests/libwfa_tests
~~~~

If you are using libwfa as part of OpenMolcas, you can use
~~~~
pymolcas verify 835
~~~~
for verification of the OpenMolcas/WFA interface.
